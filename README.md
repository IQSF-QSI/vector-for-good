# Vector for Good: Privacy-First Safety Intelligence

This repository contains the frontend application for the Vector for Good website, a platform dedicated to providing privacy-first safety intelligence for LGBTQ+ communities worldwide. The application is built with React and Vite, and it showcases a range of features including an interactive Queer Safety Index (QSi) map, zero-knowledge privacy demonstrations, and a comprehensive, enterprise-ready presentation.

## Project Overview

Vector for Good is a web application designed to empower organizations and communities with zero-knowledge safety intelligence. The platform protects what matters most while preserving privacy and human dignity. The website serves as the primary interface for users to access the QSi map, learn about the technology, and engage with the organization.

### Key Features

*   **Queer Safety Index (QSi) Map:** An interactive map that provides detailed safety information for LGBTQ+ individuals across the globe. The map is populated with comprehensive data from various sources and offers city-level granularity.
*   **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Demonstrations:** A suite of interactive demos that showcase the power of zero-knowledge proofs in preserving user privacy. Users can experience how the platform provides personalized safety insights without ever sharing their personal data.
*   **Enterprise-Ready Presentation:** A professional and polished website that effectively communicates the mission and vision of Vector for Good. The site is designed to be visually stunning, highly interactive, and ready for enterprise and investor presentations.
*   **Comprehensive Content Pages:** The website includes a variety of content pages, including an "About" page, a "Contact" page, a "Privacy Policy," and "Terms of Service."

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd vector-for-good-final/vector-website
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. To install the dependencies, run:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the development server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
