Your task is to generate the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for an editorial webpage titled 'Global Queer Safety Index 2025', adhering to a luxurious, authoritative, empowering, data-driven, and professional aesthetic. The output must be a single block of code containing all necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a fully functional and visually appealing webpage, integrating the provided `report_data` and `hero_image`.\n# Step by Step instructions\n1. Create the foundational HTML structure for the webpage, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.\n2. Within the `<head>` section, include appropriate meta tags for responsiveness and character set, a `<title>` tag set to \"Global Queer Safety Index 2025\", and a `<style>` block for CSS or a `<link>` tag to an external stylesheet.\n3. Within the `<body>` section, design a hero section that incorporates the `Hero Image` using appropriate HTML tags (e.g., `<img>` or as a background image in CSS), an elegant gradient background, bold serif typography for the title, and minimalist gold accents.\n4. Create the main content sections using semantic HTML5 tags (e.g., `<section>`, `<article>`). These sections should cover 'The State of Global Queer Safety', 'Interactive Safety Map', 'Top & Bottom Rankings', 'Methodology', and 'Take Action'.\n5. For the 'Interactive Safety Map' section, include a placeholder or basic structure for an interactive world map visualization.\n6. For the 'Top & Bottom Rankings' section, create a structure for elegant data cards that will display country rankings, integrating the `Report Data`.\n7. Ensure a clear typography hierarchy throughout the page, using appropriate heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) and paragraph tags (`<p>`).\n8. Implement the specified color palette using CSS: magenta to purple gradients, gold for accents, deep navy for primary text or backgrounds, warm white for secondary backgrounds or text, charcoal for body text, and safety indicators in emerald, amber, and coral.\n9. Add CSS rules to implement interactive elements such as hover effects for navigation or data cards, smooth scrolling, and elegant call-to-action buttons.\n10. Include a `<script>` block for JavaScript at the end of the `<body>` or link to an external JavaScript file. This script should handle any dynamic or interactive features such as expandable country profiles (if applicable to the data cards or map) and smooth scrolling.\n11. Review the generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Does it meet all the requirements for a sophisticated, magazine-quality editorial webpage, including design elements, interactive features, content sections, color palette, and integration of `Report Data` and `Hero Image`? If not, go back to the relevant step and refine the code.\n12.
